1. Typing 'make bst' creates testBST.o, BSTInt.o and BSTNodeInt.o

2. 
g++      -g -Wall -std=c++11 -c BSTInt.cpp
BSTInt.cpp: In function 'bool insert(int)':
BSTInt.cpp:25:8: error: 'root' was not declared in this scope
   if (!root) {
        ^

       ^

   ++isize;
     ^
make: *** [BSTInt.o] Error 1
[1]+  Done                    gvim BSTInt.cpp

The error that occurs is because the variables that are used are not
declared within the function. These variables were declared in the BSTInt
function, which is why the function was able to run before.
